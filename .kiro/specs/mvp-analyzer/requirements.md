# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub Actions AI Analyzer MVP is a Python-based tool that analyzes GitHub Actions workflow logs to extract structured error information and generate AI-optimized prompts for troubleshooting. This MVP focuses on core log analysis capabilities with basic error pattern detection and AI prompt generation to validate the core concept and provide immediate value to developers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using GitHub Actions, I want to analyze failed workflow logs to quickly identify the root cause of failures, so that I can resolve issues faster without manually parsing through verbose logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a GitHub Actions log file THEN the system SHALL parse and extract error information from the log
2. WHEN the system processes a log file THEN it SHALL identify at least basic error patterns (build failures, dependency issues, permission errors)
3. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL structure the error information with relevant context (line numbers, error messages, affected files)
4. IF no recognizable error patterns are found THEN the system SHALL still extract the most relevant log sections for analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer troubleshooting CI/CD issues, I want the tool to generate optimized prompts for AI services, so that I can get more accurate and actionable solutions from AI assistants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system completes log analysis THEN it SHALL generate a structured AI prompt containing the error context
2. WHEN generating AI prompts THEN the system SHALL include workflow configuration details, error messages, and relevant code context
3. WHEN creating prompts THEN the system SHALL format them to be optimized for AI services (clear structure, relevant context, specific questions)
4. IF multiple errors are detected THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most critical errors in the prompt

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the tool via command line interface, so that I can integrate it into my development workflow and automation scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs the CLI tool with a log file path THEN the system SHALL process the file and display results
2. WHEN the CLI processes a log THEN it SHALL provide clear output showing detected errors and generated prompts
3. WHEN the tool encounters invalid input THEN it SHALL display helpful error messages and usage instructions
4. IF the user requests help THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive usage documentation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want the tool to recognize Python-specific error patterns, so that I get more accurate analysis for my Python projects in GitHub Actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing logs from Python projects THEN the system SHALL detect Python-specific error patterns (import errors, syntax errors, dependency conflicts, pip installation failures)
2. WHEN the system encounters Python test failures THEN it SHALL extract test names, failure reasons, and relevant code context
3. WHEN Python linting or formatting errors occur THEN the system SHALL identify the specific tools and error messages
4. IF no Python-specific patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL apply generic error pattern matching

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to output results in multiple formats, so that I can use the analysis in different contexts (terminal display, file storage, integration with other tools).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user specifies JSON output format THEN the system SHALL provide structured JSON with all analysis results
2. WHEN the user specifies text output format THEN the system SHALL provide human-readable formatted output
3. WHEN no output format is specified THEN the system SHALL default to human-readable text format
4. IF the user requests file output THEN the system SHALL save results to the specified file path

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to handle various GitHub Actions log formats and sources, so that I can analyze logs regardless of how I obtained them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN provided with raw GitHub Actions log files THEN the system SHALL parse the standard GitHub Actions log format
2. WHEN processing logs with timestamps and metadata THEN the system SHALL extract relevant information while filtering noise
3. WHEN encountering malformed or partial logs THEN the system SHALL process available content and report any limitations
4. IF the log file is empty or unreadable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the issue
